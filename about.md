Machine Learning at ITB (ML@ITB) is a student-run organization based at Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) with a mission to build a vigorous machine learning community on campus. We aim to do so by providing educations, projects, and seminars in the machine learning field to provide students interested in machine learning to learn and get dirty with hands-on experience by building challenging and interesting projects.

ML@ITB is inspired by other machine learning communities, such as [ML@B](https://ml.berkeley.edu/) and [Stanford ML Group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/) that collectively have nurtured thousands of machine learning enthusiasts. We hope that we could do similar feats in providing home for many future practicioners in the machine learning field.

P.S. We are independent from Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB). We take full credit for our organization.
